# MDS Data analysis peer review 2024-24

This repository is the home to the UBC Master of [Data Science Workflows course](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_dsci-workflows) open peer review. In this course students work in teams to build data analysis projects using R and Python, and perform open peer review of the projects they develop. To do this, the students follow the peer review process inspired by the [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/), [JOSE](https://jose.theoj.org/) and [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) organizations. 

## Peer review process
